### Introduction

AndroSci is an Android OS, built as graduation project application for the MSc in Media Technology from the University of Leiden (http://mediatechnology.leiden.edu/)

---------

### Overview

This app helps scientists to manage the users of their experiments by means of logging calls, SMS and location coordinates of these users, so the researchers can
later withdraw conclusions in an easier way from the data and information gathered.

---------

### Dependencies

AndroSci uses the libraries [CWAC-LOCPOL] (https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-locpoll) and [CWAC-WAKEFUL] (https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-wakeful), 
two AWESOME libraries created by [CommonsGuy] (https://github.com/commonsguy) to help the application perform its tasks.

Although this code corresponds only to the mobile application, AndroSci is meant to be used with a remote Apache server and a MySQL DB in order to be able to interchange data.
We have also created the web application to be installed in the remote Apache server so as to provide a way for scientists to interact and visualize the data.
